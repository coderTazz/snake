# Different Snake Implementations

Implementing Snake in C++ using following methods:
*	A Command Line based implementaion (Inspired from NVitatonix Youtube tutorial)
*	A SDL based implementation(yet to start)




## Issues

* The command line based implementation requires pressing Return everytime user makes a turn. Need to implement a non blocking keyboard input method.
